# Coursera Capstone - The Battle of the Neighbourhoods

We have come to the final stage of becoming a skilled data scientist. The specialisation course involved 9 components including Machine Learning in Python. The final project entails the use of tools and skills learned throughout the course to explore a geographical location of our choice. For this project, I have decided to market a  property in Perth, Australia to a potential buyer. I would like to write a convincing report and present my data in the most daring way. I intend to use some machine learning tools in this project. Finally, I will present my data using Tableau. 

Aim: My goal is to use Python, SQL, machine learning algorithms and Tableau. 

I have begun procuring data for the project. The README will be periodically updated using Git Bash (Version Control).
